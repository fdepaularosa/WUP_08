```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```

## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

the adjusted r squared for LENGTH ~ NECK is 0.7476.

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~AGE,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~AGE,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

the adjusted r squared for LENGTH ~ AGE is 0.5073

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

the adjusted r squared for LENGTH ~ HEADLEN is 0.8435

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~HEADWTH,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADWTH,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

the adjusted r squared for LENGTH ~ HEADWTH is 0.5321

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

the adjusted r squared for LENGTH ~ CHEST is 0.7869

## Compare all models that predict LENGTH other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better.
